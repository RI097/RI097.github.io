        <hr>
        <div id="Problem" class="">
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <h5>
            <mark class="adore">Adopting a pet</mark> is a life changing decision to begin with.Light should be shed on <mark class='adore'>adopting rather than buying</mark> pets.The pet adoption process should be <mark class='adore'>hassle free</mark> and <mark class='adore'>easy to go through</mark>.These processes need to be as clear as possible
            Most of the procedure is transferred <mark class='adore'>online in the times of covid.</mark>
            
            <h5>
            Importance of adopting,covering areas of petcare and what a pet parent should understand and know about the pet and making the adoption process simple and online:these are just a few goals Adore plans to accomplish and make sure you are ready when you plan to welcome a pet!
            
            <br><br></h5>
<h5>
            There are <mark class='adore'>three parts of the problem</mark> that I have focussed on in this case study:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
           <li> Help the pet find owner who will take care of it,</li>
           <li> simplify the adoption process and </li>
           <li> help you take care of your pet.</li>
          </ul>
          </h5>
<br>
          <h5>Another two aspects that I plan to include were <mark class="adore"> volunteering</mark> and <mark class="adore">donation</mark>.Many pet parents or even general citizens <mark class="adore">want to help out</mark> in their free time but are <mark class="adore">clueless</mark> of how they can help the animal shelters.So I even want to try to <mark class="adore">resolve this too through my design.</mark> </h5>

        <div id="Solution" class="subgroup">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <h5>I have designed Adore to resolve these solutions.It gets you to speed with <mark class="adore">how the adoption will go through</mark>.Apart from a hassle free adoption,it also gives you a <mark class="adore">map of nearby vets and medical centers</mark>.It gets you ready for your journey of getting your pet home to <mark class="adore">raising it well and taking care of it</mark>.
            </h5>
            <h5>
            It even acts as a bridge if you are up for <mark class="adore">volunteering at any animal shelters or donating to them.</mark></h5>

            <h5>The main goal was to <mark class="adore">make sure people get comfortable with adopting pets and don't have any misconceptions,fears or confusion</mark>.They know that they will have <mark class="adore">someone to love them.</mark> </h5>

       <h5>After that I went through an interview preperation stage.Interview preparation is just as important as conducting the interview.Asking the right questions gets you thinking in a particular direction and if you keep that in mind,it can be useful during the ideation stages.</h5>

            <h5>The fact that getting a pet home is fun but also <mark class="adore">involves responsibilities</mark> so I wanted my research to be solid and <mark class="adore">touch everything the represenative sample will go through.</mark></h5>

            <h5>After this,I proceeded to the how might we technique.</h5>

<br>
Since the design is supposed to be responsive,<mark class="adore">two different wireframes were created according to the device</mark>.This model then went for testing before increasing the fidelity.
<br>
I like to <mark class="adore">check the usability of the design</mark> with the low fidelity prototype itself as it <mark class="adore">helps user focus on the basic user flows and navigation flows more accurately</mark>.With colour or style,it may be aesthetically pleasing but it doesn't guarantee true reviews about the usability.
<br>
This is done keeping the <mark class="adore">aesthetic usability effect</mark> in mind.
This effect is again used when colours,patterns and styles are added to make sure the colours are pleasant enough to overlook a few usability concerns.

        <h5>
          <mark class="adore">Adopting a pet</mark> is a life changing decision to begin with.Light should be shed on <mark class='adore'>adopting rather than buying</mark> pets.The pet adoption process should be <mark class='adore'>hassle free</mark> and <mark class='adore'>easy to go through</mark>.These processes need to be as clear as possible
          Most of the procedure is transferred <mark class='adore'>online in the times of covid.</mark>
          
          <h5>
          Importance of adopting,covering areas of petcare and what a pet parent should understand and know about the pet and making the adoption process simple and online:these are just a few goals Adore plans to accomplish and make sure you are ready when you plan to welcome a pet!
          
          <br><br></h5>
<h5>
          There are <mark class='adore'>three parts of the problem</mark> that I have focussed on in this case study:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
         <li> Help the pet find owner who will take care of it,</li>
         <li> simplify the adoption process and </li>
         <li> help you take care of your pet.</li>
        </ul>
        </h5>

          </h5>
          <h5>
          It even acts as a bridge if you are up for <mark class="adore">volunteering at any animal shelters or donating to them.</mark></h5>

          <h5>The main goal was to <mark class="adore">make sure people get comfortable with adopting pets and don't have any misconceptions,fears or confusion</mark>.They know that they will have <mark class="adore">someone to love them.</mark> </h5>

        <h5>I conducted a competitive analysis as the next step.It was divided into two parts where I conduct an <mark class="adore">audit</mark> and make a crisp <mark class="adore">report</mark> for that.</h5>
        <h5>The competitive audit was conducted on the terms of the <mark class="adore">visual design, content, interaction, accessibility</mark>, and <mark class="adore">user flow</mark>.The brand's unique value proposition was also noticed.

        <br><br>
        
<h5>The competitive analysis was conducted in two stages.In the first step,the companies were <mark class="adore">individually audited and then a <mark class="adore">cumulative audit report</mark> was generated.The report had <mark class="adore">concise points and findings relating to the features of their design.</mark></h5>

        <h5>It gives my whole mockup plan a structure.It also makes it easier for me to wireframe according to it and simplifes the user flows.</h5>
        <h5>For creating the information architecture,I worked along the lines of five major sections of the designs.</h5>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/adore/photos/basic ideation.jpg">
        <h5>Then I proceeded on <mark class="adore">developing features</mark> of these sections.I explored various options to put in each categories and only the necessary ones were chosen.An excess of options could confuse the user and increase the complexity of decisions or options chosen.</h5>

        <h5>Based on the information architecture and the basic user flow,I proceeded to draw free hand.</h5>    
          <h5>
            For this design,I used the <mark class="adore">responsive web design</mark>.I started sketching the paper wireframes for my website initially before moving on to the mobile layout.</h5>
            <h5>
              Adore is a project which will be a <mark class="adore">responsive web design</mark> with a <mark class="adore">dedicated mobile app</mark>.

            <h5>
              The approach that I took for sketching wireframes is also called the <mark class="adore">top down approach</mark>.In this approach,I start <mark class="adore">designing for a bigger screen sizes(laptop and tablets) before moving on to the smaller screen sizes(mobile phones)</mark>.              </h5>

        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <h5>As the first step,I <mark class="adore">converted the paper wireframes to digital wireframes</mark>.
<br>
Since the design is supposed to be responsive,<mark class="adore">two different wireframes were created according to the device</mark>.This model then went for testing before increasing the fidelity.
<br>
I like to <mark class="adore">check the usability of the design</mark> with the low fidelity prototype itself as it <mark class="adore">helps user focus on the basic user flows and navigation flows more accurately</mark>.With colour or style,it may be aesthetically pleasing but it doesn't guarantee true reviews about the usability.
<br>
This is done keeping the <mark class="adore">aesthetic usability effect</mark> in mind.
This effect is again used when colours,patterns and styles are added to make sure the colours are pleasant enough to overlook a few usability concerns.
